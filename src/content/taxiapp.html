  After one too many treks through a random neighborhood of Kowloon, trying to
  remember where I saw a cross-harbour taxi stand several hours before, I
  thought there might be an opportunity for a solution. Although other mobile
  apps map out the location of cross-harbour taxi stands, I thought that the
  user interface could be improved.

<p class="long">
  Cross-Harbour Taxi Stands are locations where passengers can ride between Hong
  Kong Island &amp; Kowloon and only need to pay for the tunnel fee one-way. If
  they grab a cab on the street or at a normal taxi stand, they'll be
  responsible to pay $10-15 for the driver's trip back as well. In addition,
  taxis are divided into three groups by geography and given different colors.
  My app helps users filter more than 400 taxi stands by both of these criteria
  and get directions from their current location to whichever stand they prefer.
  The interface can easily be switched back and forth from English to Chinese.

<p class="long">
  If the user is nowhere near a taxi stand, the app has a few options left. It
  has phone numbers for all the taxi depots in Hong Kong, as well as links to
  multiple other mobile apps that can help the user bring a taxi to them.
