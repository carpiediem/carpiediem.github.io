  After one too many treks through unfamiliar areas in Hong Kong, it is useful
  to know the locations of cross-harbour taxi stands. Although other mobile apps
  map out the location of cross-harbour taxi stands, I wanted to improve the
  user interface.

  Cross-Harbour taxi stands are locations where passengers can ride between Hong
  Kong Island and Kowloon and only need to pay for the tunnel fee one-way. If
  they grab a cab on the street or at a normal taxi stand, riders are
  responsible to pay for the driver's tunnel fee for the trip back as well. In
  addition, taxis are divided into three groups by geography and given different
  colors. My app helps users filter more than 400 taxi stands by both of these
  criteria and get directions from their current location to whichever stand
  they prefer. The interface can be switched back and forth from English to
  Chinese.

  If the user is not near a taxi stand, the app presents a few options. It has
  phone numbers for all the taxi depots in Hong Kong, as well as links to other
  mobile apps that can help the user bring a taxi to them.
