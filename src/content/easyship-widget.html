    Shopify has a built-in API for displaying express shipping services (e.g. FedEx, DHL) to users buying from an
    online store and Easyship has been leveraging this feature for years. When our team wanted to offer insurance
    policies for those shipping solutions, however, we needed to build our own solution.

    I developed a <a href="https://shopify.dev/api/liquid" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Liquid</a>
    snippet that could be automatically added to the custom theme of our customers' Shopify
    stores. This was built to work with most popular themes and behave consistently whether it was rendered in a full
    page, modal, or drawer. There was a remarkable variation in the way different Shopify themes managed the checkout
    flow, but our widget has managed to work well despite this.

    Making it easier for buyers to purchase reasonably-priced insurance policies has not only simplified the financial
    issues related to replacing lost or damaged shipments, it has also improved buyer-satisfaction with the merchants
    from whom they have purchased (Easyship's customers).
