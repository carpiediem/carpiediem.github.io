  My wife and I served as captains for our masters' swimming team (age 25 to 80)
  for five years. Although meets and teams in many countries are managed
  exclusively online, Hong Kong swimming remains mired in lots of paperwork.
  When we joined the team, it would take several hours to prepare entry forms
  for each competition the team entered.

  Using

  in their Forms &amp; Sheets products, I developed software for sign-up forms
  to be automatically generated for each upcoming competition. The software
  outputs entry forms that match the handwritten paperwork required by the Hong
  Kong Amateur Swimming Association, as well as worksheets to be used during the
  meets. The worksheets help our teammates know when it is time to swim and help
  our coaches record finish times, splits, and placement results as they race.

  When the times are entered into the digital copy of the worksheet, the
  software checks for new records and personal best times. Team records are
  automatically updated for later comparison with

  present to our various stakeholders.
