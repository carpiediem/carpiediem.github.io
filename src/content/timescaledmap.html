  created by Peter Dunn of Stone Brown Design and thought that something similar
  should exist for Hong Kong.

  Hong Kong doesn't have the same hub &amp; spoke layout as Boston, so I had to
  choose a station for the "starting point." Central was the closest station to
  me, though a map centered on Admiralty, Mongkok, or Hung Hom would be an
  interesting follow-up.
  <a href="timescaledmap/polar.png" target="_blank">My first draft</a> attempted
  to display train frequency information, as well as trip duration, though I'm
  not certain that I handled the transfer stations in a logical way. For
  instance, Yau Ma Tei has twice as many trains pass through it as Jordan, but
  does that mean the station is really twice as busy?

<p class="long">
  In <a href="timescaledmap/vertical.png" target="_blank">a later version</a>, I
  set the "start time" at the top of the page and drew parallel streams downward
  to every possible destination. I think this allowed me to more clearly show
  how much time is spent on trains vs. walking through transfer stations, but it
  seems to go even farther toward the false notion that Central is the most
  important node in the network. Lastly, I included two new lines that are still
  under construction, as a reference for later.
