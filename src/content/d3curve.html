    While fiddling with some transit map projects, I found myself experimenting with
    <a>d3</a> as a way to programmaticaly draw curved lines for SVGs and websites. The library creates beautiful
    <a href="https://www.d3indepth.com/shapes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BÃ©zier curves</a>,
    but it didn't have built-in support for the kind you'd see in a transit diagram.

    d3 makes use of modularized curve functions to plot curves in different ways, so I developed my own. This one takes
    a curve radius as a parameter, then connects an array of Cartesian coordinates with straight lines that curve just
    the right way near each veertex.
