  is the oldest Chinese document showing a large part of the world outside
  China. It is largely based on the voyages of Zheng He during the Ming Dynasty.
  As an intersection between history, cartography, and my current home, Hong
  Kong, I am fascinated by the map, but it is very difficult to use. The map was
  originally printed on 18 sheets of paper, read right to left from Nanjing to
  Hormuz. I decided to build a website for the map once I discovered

  I created a map editing tool in React.js and Leaflet.js. I advertised it in
  various online communities interested in Chinese history, in order to
  crowd-source the transcription and translation of the map. Volunteers click on
  a map label, then enter its text, translation, and (if known) modern name in a
  small form. In this way, all 551 plotted locations were transcribed, along
  with a few dozen long strings of navigation instructions. I researched many
  historical references to identify as many locations as possible, including
  latitude and longitude of each point.

  With this data compiled, I generated a geoJSON file with all the details to
  plot on both the Mao Kun map and a modern projection of the globe. In the
  "explore" version of the website, these maps are presented one above the
  other. Dragging the Mao Kun map causes the modern map to automatically pan
  toward the equivalent view. Clicking on a marker in one map, highlights its
  twin in the other. Each marker links to Wikipedia articles related to the
  place in question.

  At the top, a colorful mini-map shows the entire Mao Kun map at once, with
  colors corresponding to the borders of modern provinces and nations.
