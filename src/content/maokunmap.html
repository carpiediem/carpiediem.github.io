  is the oldest Chinese document showing a large part of the world outside
  China. It's largely based on the voyages of Zheng He during the Ming Dynasty.
  As an intersection between history, cartography, and my current home, Hong
  Kong, the map has interested me for a while. But, I've been frustrated with
  how difficult it can be to read.

<p>
  The map was originally printed on 18 sheets of paper, read right to left from
  Nanjing to Hormuz. My interest in building a web site for the map grew once I
  stumbled upon

  I started by building a map editing tool in React.js and Leaflet.js. I
  advertised it in various online communities interested in Chinese History, in
  order to crowd-source the transcription and translation of the map. Volunteers
  could click on a map label, then enter it's text, translation and (if known)
  modern name in a small form. In this way, all 551 plotted locations were
  transcribed, along with a few dozen long strings of navigation instructions. I
  dug through some historical references to identify as many locations as
  possible, including latitude and longitude of each.
</p>
<p>
  With this data compiled, I generated a geoJSON file with all the details to
  plot on both the Mao Kun map and a modern projection of the globe. In the
  "explore" version of the web site, these maps are presented one above the
  other. Dragging the Mao Kun map causes the modern map to automatically pan
  toward the equivalent view. Clicking on a marker in one map highlights its
  twin in the other. Each marker links to Wikipedia articles related to the
  place in question.

  At the top, a colorful mini-map shows the entire Mao Kun map at once, with
  colors corresponding to the borders of modern provinces and nations.
