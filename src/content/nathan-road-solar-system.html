    My daughter seems to share my enthusiasm for maps, so I've made <a href="./mtr-color-map">a few with her in mind</a>. This one was an opportunity
    to think about the scale of outer space while Hong Kong's museums were all closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. I
    thought Nathan Road would be a great location for a scale model of the solar system, given that it's the logest
    straightish street in Hong Kong and it has appropriate landmarks on its opposite ends: the space museum and Boundary
    Street (named for the edge of the colony from 1860-1898).

    Matching this to the distance from the Sun to the heliopause gives a ratio of about 5 billion to one, reducing the
    sun to an oversized basketball. Rather than make a single map, I prepared worksheets that identify the location of
    each planet within the model and picture them at the proper scale. This makes for a fun outing of finding each
    location and taking out the card to talk about each one. It also keeps the planets within a reasonable walk- Pluto's
    average orbit is just inside of Jordan Road. Proxima Centauri, for comparison, is another 8,000 km away, nearing the
    North Pole.
