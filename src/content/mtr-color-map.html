    My daughter seems to share my enthusiasm for maps, so I made
    <a href="./nathan-road-solar-system">a few with her in mind</a>.
    This one started when she was still far to young to read, but loved to ride the MTR subway trains.

    The map has all the same stations as
    <a href="https://www.mtr.com.hk/en/customer/services/system_map.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
        the officialMTR map
    </a>
    (plus a few still in constuction/planning), but instead of leaning on the colors of the train lines, this map
    highlights the colors of the stations. One of the
    <a href="https://the-sia-brat.com/2015/02/05/hong-kong-stops/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delightful</a>
    aspects of the MTR system is the themetic colors of the tile walls throughout most of the stations. These were a
    design solution to two problems when the first stations were built in the 1970s: dark, windowless spaces and a
    significant portion of the population that was still illiterate. Bright colors not only made the system more
    cheerful, they made it easier for some riders to find the right place to get off, without having to read every sign.

    Today, Hong Kong has one of the best-educated populations in the world, but the colors still make wayfinding easier
    for three-year-olds. To that end, this map shows how each station is connected, color by color.
