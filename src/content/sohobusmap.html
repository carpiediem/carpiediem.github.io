  A spider map is designed to show transit routes that depart from a single
  location. It is primarily designed to be a visual display for pedestrians to
  view as they leave a train and look for the correct bus for their destination.
  Transport for London uses these maps extensively to show

  Peter's work made me think that Hong Kong might be good place to implement
  spider maps like these. Although commuters may not need to look at a map to
  figure out where they are going, Hong Kong residents often take public
  transportation to reach parts of town that they don't know well. In addition,
  visitors may take public buses to reach certain destinations (e.g. Sai Kung,
  Southern District, or Lantau Island). Right now, the MTR labels station exits
  that are near bus stops, but there is rarely any indication of which routes
  pass by each exit.

  Hong Kong has a complex network of public bus routes. There are five different
  companies [<a

  streets of Washington, DC; unfortunately, Hong Kong has a maze of curvy roads
  (many of them one-way only). A prototype was necessary to see how all the
  pieces might work together. I created a spider map for the area near my home
  in SoHo, so friends and family could use it.

  I would love to see a map like this made for each MTR station and posted on
  the wall. It would fill in an important information gap for passengers.

  If you like the map I made, feel free to
  <a href="/downloads/SoHoBusMap.pdf">print it out</a> and use it. If you would
  like to see more, consider asking the MTR [<a
