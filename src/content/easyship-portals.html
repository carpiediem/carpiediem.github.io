<p>
    In addition to managing the development of new features in Easyship's primary application (and migrating it from
    AngularJS to React), I created the starter template for several smaller applications that were built in React from
    the ground up. The user base for these was the customers of Easyship's customers- buyers at an online store or
    crowdfunding campaign. These new portals have opened new lines of business for both Easyship and our customers.
