<h2>Time-Scaled Maps</h2>
<p>
  I was intrigued by the time-scaled diagrams of

  created by Peter Dunn of Stone Brown Design and thought that something similar
  should exist for Hong Kong.
</p>
<p>
  Hong Kong doesn't have the same hub &amp; spoke layout as Boston, so I had to
  choose a station for the "starting point." Central was the closest station to
  me, though a map centered on Admiralty, Mongkok, or Hung Hom would be an
  interesting follow-up.

    >My first draft</a
  >
  attempted to display train frequency information, as well as trip duration,
  though I'm not certain that I handled the transfer stations in a logical way.
  For instance, Yau Ma Tei has twice as many trains pass through it as Jordan,
  but does that mean the station is really twice as busy?
</p>
<p>
  In
  <a href="timescaledmap/time-scaled-mtr-map-vertical.png" target="_blank"
    >a later version</a
  >, I set the "start time" at the top of the page and drew parallel streams
  downward to every possible destination. I think this allowed me to more
  clearly show how much time is spent on trains vs. walking through transfer
  stations, but it seems to go even farther toward the false notion that Central
  is the most important node in the network. Lastly, I included two new lines
  that are still under construction, as a reference for later.

  If you like this kind of map, I've seen them for

<h2>Playful Translations</h2>

<p>
  Each station in the MTR has a name in Chinese and English. For some, the names
  are translations of one another (e.g. "Central" and "中環"). For others, a
  name was chosen in one language and the name in the other language is a
  transliteration that sounds the same, but isn't a native word (e.g. "柴灣" to
  "Chai Wan" or "Jordan" to "佐敦").
</p>
<p>
  <a href="/downloads/hk-mtr-swapped-translations-transliterations.pdf"

  highlights those differences by swapping them. All stations (and other
  landmarks) with translated English names now have transliterated names. All
  the stations that usually use transliterated names are translated here. Just a
  bit of fun to see the neighborhoods of Hong Kong in a new light.

<h2>Accessible Transit</h2>

<p>
  Hong Kong's MTR may not have the grand passageways of St. Petersburg's subway
  or the art nouveau style of Paris' Metropolitain. But it definately has a lot
  of color. Colors were designed to clearly distinguish one station from another
  and to highlight transfer points with bright colors. This was especially
  useful when Hong Kong's literacy rate was still quite low.
</p>
<p>
  Today, adult Hong Kongers don't struggle with reading the signs, but my
  three-year-old daughter still found the station colors very helpful. To help
  her visualize how we travel around the city and to introduce her to maps, in
  general, I made this. Instead of focusing on the colors of the lines, it draws
  your eye to the colors of each station, making it easy to track each one you
  pass.

  Another different perspective on the MTR network,
