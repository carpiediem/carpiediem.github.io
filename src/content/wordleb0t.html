  Wordleb0t is both a
  <a href="https://wordleb0t.rslc.us/" target="_blank">web-based game</a>
  and a
  <a href="https://twitter.com/wordleb0t" target="_blank">Twitter-facing microservice</a>
  that plays games of
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wordle</a>.
  I built it to see how effective a simple algorithm could be at solving this kind of game.

  Wordleb0t uses two dictionaries: a broad word set containing every English word that is not a proper noun and a more
  limited set that is ranked by usage among typical English speakers. These were both forked from
  <a href="https://twitter.com/chordbug" target="_blank">@chordbug</a>'s
  excellent <a href="https://github.com/lynn/hello-wordl" target="_blank">hello wordl</a>
  project. These are used to calculate, for any given word, a weighted score from its usage rank and how often its
  individual letters are found in other words. Possible guesses are limited by a regular expression built from the
  letters and colors from each round played.

  It performs quite well. It has a 100% win rate on the official wordle game and even I have a hard time picking words
  that will stump it ("sandy" proved too much). Have a try and see how you do.
