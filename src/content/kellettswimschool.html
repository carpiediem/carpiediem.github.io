  As Swimming Director at Hong Kong's
  <a href="https://swim.connect.kellettschool.com/kellett-swim-school" target="_blank">Kellett School</a>,
  my wife created hours of video content and dozens of instruction sets for different swimming drills. These went into
  great detail, to support and build consistency among her coaching team. It was difficult, however, to quickly find a
  specific video, and instructions wound up filling long documents that were hard to read.

  I compiled the content her team created and built a React.js app around it.
  This made her content more searchable and provided interactive tools for
  planning individual lessons from among the many drill options. To ensure that
  their proprietary instruction was not made publicly available, access is
  protected with AWS Cognito user pools through a CloudFront distribution.
