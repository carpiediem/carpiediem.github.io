  As Swimming Director at Hong Kong's
  <a href="" target="_blank">Kellett School</a>, my wife created hours of video
  content and dozens of instruction sets for different swimming drills. These
  went into great detail, to support and build consistancy among her coaching
  team, but it was difficult to quickly find a specific video and instructions
  wound up filling long documents that were difficult to read through.

  I helped compile the content her team created and built a React.js app around
  it. This made her content more searchable and provided interactive tools for
  planning individual lessons from among the many drill options. To ensure that
  their proprietary instruction wasn't made publicaly available, access is
  protected with AWS Cognito user pools through a CloudFront distribution.
