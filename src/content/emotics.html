  At <a href="https://emotics.co" target="_blank">Emotics</a>, I built a suite
  of tools to collect data, submit and process it, and display it to
  stakeholders. This starts with a modularized JavaScript SDK, which allows
  different features to be easily enabled, disabled, and configured in different
  integrations. The SDK can be embedded directly into web pages or packaged into
  e-learning content, like SCORM modules. The SCORM injects a new menu into the
  existing content to present terms and conditions to the learner and to request
  that they agree to have the learning session monitored. It then captures
  snapshots from the webcam and analyzes the imagery for authentication and
  attention tracking.

  No imagery leaves the learners' computers. Instead, our artificial
  intelligence runs in their browser and sends only its results to the Emotics
  API. This is built on Express.js and deployed with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to
  ensure scalability and reliable service. This utilizes a PostreSQL database
  cluster on RDS for storage.

  After post-processing to summarize each session and optimize data schemas for
  reporting, our analytics front-end console can be used to review the collected
  data and the insights our system provides. Compliance managers are able to
  identify potential problems with ignored sessions or cheating, and learning
  management teams can identify exactly which elements of their content are
  succeeding and which content was not engaging to learners. The console is
  built as a React.js single-page app using material design standards.
