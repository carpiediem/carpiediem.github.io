  At <a href="https://emotics.co" target="_blank">Emotics</a>, I built a suite
  of tools to collect data, submit and process it, and display it to
  stakeholders. This started with a modularized JavaScript SDK, which allowed
  different features to be easily enabled, disable, and configured in different
  integrations. The SDK could be embedded directly into web pages or packaged
  into e-learning content, like SCORM modules. The SCORM injected a new menu
  into the existing content to present terms and conditions to the learner and
  request that they agree to have the learning session monitored. After that it
  would capture snapshots from the webcam and analyze the imagery for
  authentication and attention tracking.

  No imagery left the learners' laptops. Instead our artificial intelligence ran
  in their browser and sent only its results to the Emotics API. This was built
  on Express.js and deployed with AWS Elastic Beanstalk to ensure scalability
  and reliable service. This utilized a PostreSQL database cluster on RDS for
  storage.

  After some post-processing to summarize each session and optimize data schemas
  for reporting, our analytics console front-end could be used to review the
  collected data and the insights our system provided. Compiance managers could
  identify potential problems with ignored sessions or cheating and learning
  management teams could identify exactly which elements of their content were
  succeeding and which were putting learners to sleep. The console was built as
  a React.js single-page app using material design standards.
