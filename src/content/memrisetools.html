  When I started studying Mandarin Chinese, I found a relatively new learning
  website named
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.memrise.com/">Memrise.com</a>. At its
  core, Memrise is a set of flashcards that help you remember facts of all
  types, from animal identification to history trivia. Most of their content,
  however, focuses on learning foreign languages, as I was. Flash cards are
  presented not in a strict order, but algorithmically- the words that Memrise
  thinks you should prioritize.

<p class="long">
  Courses are mostly user-curated (<a

    >I made a few</a

  to match the vocabulary in my courses' textbooks). Each "flashcard" is
  augmented with what the website calls
  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.memrise.com/user/carpiediem/mems/created/"
    >mems</a
  >
  (a play on
  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme">memes</a>) that
  help learners remember individual facts using visual, audio, or mnemonic cues.

  Although the platform grew in user-based content, it was poorly maintained for
  quite awhile. User forums were identifying easy-to-do improvements, but
  Memrise did not have the manpower to implement them. I joined a few other
  volunteers in writing
  <a
    target="_blank"
    href="https://github.com/carpiediem/memrise-enhancement-suite"
    >user scripts</a
  >
  to make temporary fixes and improvements to the site. Most of these no longer
  work, since Memrise has since been through a few redesigns, but they were good
  practice in reverse-engineering an existing app.
