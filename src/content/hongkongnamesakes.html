  In Hong Kong, buildings are replaced at such a rapid rate that history seems
  to be swept away with every new construction site. Still, the roads between
  the buildings still carry a long heritage from its colonial past.

  This map is a compilation of every street in the Hong Kong SAR named after a
  human being. Each is colored according to the reason for the person's
  prominance. Royalty are in purple, military in red, goverment officials in
  blue and orange, plus business and religious leaders in green.
